In electronics, pertaining to an equipment incapable of amplification or power generation.
Operating on the borderline of superconductivity and ordinary conductivity, they produce immense amplification.
We may conclude that transistors will be used wherever efficient amplification required within a small space.
Methods: The erm genes of MRCNS were detected by degenerate primers amplification.
ConclusionThis amplification system is very economical, convenient, and the band is clear and stable.
The site responses do not show significant amplifications, which is consistent with their basement on rocks.
There are three main molecular imaging techniques: molecular probes, signal amplifications and supersensitive survey meters.
The final version should then include whatever corrections, additions, or amplifications are considered necessary before submission.
For the best performance, we suggest to connect one power supply unit to 2 amplifications units.
